# Are You Depressed?

With the rise of a new foe, humanity suffers an everlasting pandemic, spreading like wildfire with the slyness of a fox.
The said pandemic has caused many world leaders to take action, ceasing the rights of everyone's ability to roam freely on land, sea and sky. 
The actions were solely to deter the uprising of the new enemy, COVID-19, however, the effects that it would take on some or many individuals were dreary.

With the lack of communication and interaction with those of the same species, humans laid dormant in their homes, taking a toll on those who find it sickening. 
This directly impacts their mental health, giving them issues such as depression, anxiety and stress.

As to recognise those who are victims to the mental impact the enemy has brought, we developed a web app that uses DASS-21 so people can assess their mental health easily. 
The web app is called **Are You Depressed?**
