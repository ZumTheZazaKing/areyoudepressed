# Are You Depressed?

With the rise of a new foe, humanity suffers an everlasting pandemic, spreading like wildfire with the slyness of a fox.
The said pandemic has caused many world leaders to take action, ceasing the rights of everyone's ability to roam freely on land, sea and sky. 
The actions were solely to deter the uprising of the new enemy, COVID-19, however, the effects that it would take on some or many individuals were dreary.

With the lack of communication and interaction with those of the same species, humans laid dormant in their homes, taking a toll on those who find it sickening. 
This directly impacts their mental health, giving them issues such as depression, anxiety and stress.

As to recognise those who are victims to the mental impact the enemy has brought, we developed a web app that uses DASS-21 so people can assess their mental health easily. 
The web app is called **Are You Depressed?**

### We use DASS-21 for the test

## What is DASS-21?

The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) is a set of three self-report scales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress.

Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains 7 items, divided into subscales with similar content. The depression scale assesses dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest / involvement, anhedonia and inertia. The anxiety scale assesses autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect. The stress scale assesses difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and being easily upset / agitated, irritable / over-reactive and impatient.

Scores for depression, anxiety and stress are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items.

## Is DASS-21 reliable?

The answer is; Yes definitely. Below are a few articles to prove that DASS is valid and reliable.

### Now then, for the developers...

## What did you use for this project?

I used the following technologies for this project:

- ReactJS (A Javascript Framework)
- SASS (A CSS Framework)
- Material UI (A React UI Framework)
- Context API (State Management)
- React Router (Routing)


## Where is the source code?

All the important source code can be found in the 'src' folder on the 'master' branch. In the src folder, contains many javascript files with one css file called 'App.css' being the main css file and 'input.scss' being the SASS input for it

Before digging through the code, I'll apologize beforehand. The code is quite a mess.


## Where can I access this project's output?

You can see the web app for yourself by using the following link: http://areyoudepressed.netlify.app


## Why did you make this project?

It already answers that above but if I had to be honest, I did it for an innovation competition and for fun


## Any future plans?

I'll add chinese language option when I want to. For now, nothing big really
